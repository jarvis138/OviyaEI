        Generate embeddings and culture-specific weight vectors for a batch of texts.
        
        Embeddings are random float32 vectors of dimension 128 and their count matches the number of input texts. For each culture code, a corresponding 5-element weight distribution is returned; unknown codes receive a uniform [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2] fallback.
        
        Parameters:
            texts (List[str]): Input texts; only the list length is used to determine batch size.
            cultures (List[str]): Culture codes aligned with `texts`; each entry selects a 5-element weight vector.
        
        Returns:
            Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]: 
                - embeddings: float32 array with shape (len(texts), 128).
